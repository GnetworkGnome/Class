# TELNETLIB NOTES

Connect via Telnet with parameters defined:
remote_conn = telnetlib.Telnet(ip_addr, TELNET_PORT, TELNET_TIMEOUT)

Read output from the Terminal, until string is found or timeout expires:
output = remote_conn.read_until("sername:", TELNET_TIMEOUT)

Writing commands to the Router is used with the following command:
remote_conn.write(cmd + '\n')


Many things you write that repeat should be made into functions.


Example program is test_telnet.py for Class2.
